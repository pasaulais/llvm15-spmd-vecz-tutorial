    Title

    What it is about?
        * Vectorizing
            -> Transform whole functions using LLVM
            -> "Horizontal" vectorization
        * SPMD programs
            -> Data-parallel execution model
            -> Used with compute frameworks like OpenCL and CUDA
        * for CPU-like processors, i.e. each core has
            -> A program counter
            -> Vector SIMD unit(s)
