\begin{frame}{Structure}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Pipeline design (stages)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Each stage consists of one or more IR passes
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item Most stages require some analysis
    \begin{itemize}
        \item May be run mulitple times as stages invalidate it

\talksection{Strategy}

\begin{frame}{Implementation strategy}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Create test kernels
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Start with very simple kernels (e.g. copy buffer, add two buffers)
        \item Gradually add more features (e.g. non-sequential memory accesses, vector instructions, etc)
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item Suggested implementation order
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Preparation and packetization first (required for simplest kernels)
        \item Then easier features: builtins, memory addressing, scalarization, instantiation
        \item More complex features last: control flow, optimizations
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Memory addressing}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Uniform address -> scalar loads and stores
    \item Constant stride =1 -> vector laods and stores
    \item Constant stride >1 -> interleaved loads and stores
    \item Other -> gather loads, scatter stores

        \item Vector -> scalar bitcasts
