\begin{frame}{Structure}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Pipeline design
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $F$ is repeatedly transformed by different stages
        \item Stages are independent of each other
        \item Each stage consists of one or more IR passes
        \item Most stages require some analysis
    \end{itemize}
    \item Analyses
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Capture information about the IR to vectorize
        \item May need updating after a stage (stale information)
        \item May depend on other analyses
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Analysis Examples}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Uniform Value Analysis (UVA)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Marks values as either \uniform{uniform} or \varying{varying}
        \item \uniform{Uniform}: Packet where values are identical for all lanes
        \item \varying{Varying}: Packet where values are not identical for all lanes
    \end{itemize}

    \item Divergence Analysis
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Determines which branches, which basic blocks are \varying{divergent}
        %\item \uniform{Uniform}: Branch taken by all lanes.
        \item \varying{Divergent} branch: Some lanes take one side, remaining lanes the other side
        \item \varying{Divergent} block: Not all lanes are active when executing the block
        \item Depends on UVA
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item SIMD Width Analysis
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Chooses a 'good' width $N$ based on register/instruction usage
        \item Depends on UVA
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item ...
\end{itemize}
