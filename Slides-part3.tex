\begin{frame}{Vectorizing builtin functions}

% By vectorizing the builtin's body
% This changes the function signature (return value, some arguments)
% Builtin: the vectorizer has some knowledge of which arguments need packetization
% Need argument placeholders (cloning required)
% Packetized arguments are roots (Uniform Value Analysis)
% Return instructions are leaves (Packetization Stage)

\begin{frame}{Vectorizing user functions (no side effects)}

% Similar to builtin functions, but with no knowledge of whether arguments need
% packetization. Need to analyze this for each call site.

\begin{frame}{Vectorizing user functions (with side effects)}

% Need to pass a mask as an extra argument
% Might be simpler to just inline such functions
